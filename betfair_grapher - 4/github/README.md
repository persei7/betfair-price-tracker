A Chrome extension that provides real-time price tracking for runners on Betfair Exchange horse racing markets with interactive price history visualization.

## Features

- **Price History Visualization**: Displays a clean, minimal histogram of price movements over time:
  - Green line: Back price history
  - Red line: Lay price history
  - Up to 5 minutes of price history visible
- **Price Change Indicators**: Clearly shows price movements with color-coded indicators
- **Export Functionality**: Export complete price history data as JSON
- **Unobtrusive Overlay**: Sits neatly on the side of the Betfair Exchange interface
- **Privacy Focused**: All history is cleared when tab is closed
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on browser performance
